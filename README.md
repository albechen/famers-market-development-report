Farmers markets are gatherings held by farmers to attract consumers to purchase their goods directly rather than through a supermarket or any third-party vendors. This creates a healthy relationship between producer and consumer and promotes confidence in healthy eating. Data for farmers markets across the United States was retrieved from the [National Farmers Market Directory](https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets) where it tracks common products, location, affiliated media platforms, and more. Overall, the goal is to clean and analyze the data in R in order to consolidate a report on the profile and development of the United States farmers market industry.

The findings from the analysis were (1) regional product specialty determined through availability in markets, (2) seasons difference in markets according to region, (3) increase acceptance in federally supported payment methods for low income people, (4) and increase outreach through various media platforms. Read the [Farmers Market Development Report](https://github.com/albechen/farmers-market-development/blob/master/famers_market_development_report.pdf) for an thorough analysis on the industry, and the source [R analysis script](https://github.com/albechen/farmers-market-development/blob/master/famers_market_development_analysis.R) for how the data was extracted.

Overall, with the support of the federal government, and advances in social and community outreach, the farmer market industry is poised to grow.
